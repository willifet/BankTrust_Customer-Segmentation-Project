# Understanding customer value is at the core of effective banking strategy.

I developed an RFM-based customer segmentation framework for BankTrust, leveraging transaction data to support relationship management and retention strategy.

### 🎯 Objective

  To classify customers based on engagement and monetary value, enabling more informed decision-making across marketing, servicing, and risk functions.

### 📊 Data & Methodology

- Derived Recency, Frequency, and Monetary indicators from customer transaction history

- Conducted EDA to understand behavioral trends

- Applied K-Means clustering, validated using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

- Translated clusters into business-interpretable customer profiles

### 📈 Key Customer Segments

- High-value loyal customers

- At-risk customers with declining activity

- Low-engagement customers

- Occasional high-spend customers

### 💼 Business Applications

This segmentation can support:

✔️ Relationship manager prioritization

✔️ Retention and loyalty programs

✔️ Targeted cross-sell strategies

✔️ Portfolio-level customer analysis

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | K-Means | Streamlit | Data Visualization

#### This project highlights how data-driven segmentation strengthens long-term customer value management in banking.
